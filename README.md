# Hello, I'm Parnian Shakerian 

Let me give a brief introduction to get to know me better! I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering. I’m enthusiastic about creating intelligent systems that can truly make a difference in this world by improving human lives ever so significantly. I enjoy working with algorithms, data, and mathematical concepts as I see them as some form of puzzle. And let's be real, who doesn’t like interesting puzzles! I’m constantly learning, exploring new innovations to expand my horizons and strive to become a better version of myself each and every day.
